.SH NAME
numbench \- Benchmarking tool for Gentoo
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B numbench
module conffile [\fIoptions\fR]

.B numbench
module [\fI-h|--help\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
numbench is a tool for compiling and benchmarking numerical
libraries. It is useful to find out the implementations of common
libraries that run faster on the machine and are more accurate.
The script makes use of the portage features in order to download,
compile, install and test the packages.

.SS Configuration file
.IX Subsection "Configuration file"

.PP
In order to run a test, a configuration file has to be provided.
Each line of this file defines a package that is to be tested.
It is possible to test different versions of the same package, or
even to test many times the same package with different compile-time
environment; for each different version or environment, a different
line has to be written.

.PP
Each line begins with an identification token of the test. This
identification can contain any characters, but it is recommended
that it only contains alphanumeric digits, the period . , the minus
sign - and the underscore _ .
After the identification word, the package has to be provided. The
package specification should be fully provided, in the usual
category/package-version[-revision] format. For instance
sci-libs/lapack-reference-3.3.1-r1. However, the script will try to
choose the best package in case of lacking information.
After the package, the environment has to be specified. In order
to do that, the user has to use the KEY=VALUE format. If the value
contains a whitespace, the single or double quoting marks have to be
used. The following are two valid configuration lines that define
the tests for the sci-libs/atlas package with different compilers
and CFLAGS:

.RS
atlas-gcc sci-libs/atlas-3.9.46 CC=gcc CFLAGS=-O2

atlas-gcc-4.6.1 sci-libs/atlas-3.9.46 CC=gcc-4.6.1 CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native"
.RE

.PP
Variables that affect the emerge process, such as USE, can be used
and are effective.
Another possibility to set the environment used during the emerge process is
writing a bash script that uses the export directives. These files have to be
specified added to the line with a leading @ mark. More files can be specified;
in this case the latter files override the variables in case of collisions;
the environment variables that are specified on the configuration line override
the variables set through files in case of collisions. The files can be
specified with both a relative path or an absolute one. The following examples
show this feature:

.RS
atlas-gcc sci-libs/atlas-3.9.46 @envforatlas.sh @envforgcc

atlas-gcc sci-libs/atlas-3.9.46 @envforatlas.sh CC=gcc-4.6.1 CFLAGS="-O3"
.RE

.PP
More configuration options are available. As each package can
install many implementations of the same library (for instance, the
sci-libs/atlas package installs the serial version and the
parallelized version with threads or openmp, depending on the USE
flags), each implementation is tested; but if you do not want to
test a specific implementation, you can mask it by adding to the
configuration line the string '-implementation' (without quoting
marks); then the script will skip the implementation. The following
is an example where the 32-bit implementations of the acml are
skipped:

.RS
acml sci-libs/acml-4.4.0 -acml32-gfortran -acml32-gfortran-openmp
.RE

.PP
The last configuration option that can be used is for libraries that
internally use other libraries. For example, most LAPACK
implementations lie on BLAS and/or CBLAS implementations. It is
possible to make the tested LAPACK implementation use a specific
BLAS implementation through the 'blas:implementation' (without
quotation marks) format. For instance, the following line
defines a test where the atlas LAPACK implementation uses the
openblas library as BLAS and CBLAS (openblas has to be installed for
this to work):

.RS
atlas sci-libs/atlas-3.9.46 blas:openblas
.RE

.PP
Some examples of configuration files are available in the directory
/usr/share/numbench/samples. Please refer to those files to see some detailed
working configuration files.


.SS Logs

.PP
A complete set of log is saved during the execution of the script. The script
itself will print at the beginning the directory where the logs are saved.
In the directory you will find the file main.log, which contains everything
that is written to the terminal and a directory for each test which is defined
in the configuration file. Each of them contains the log of the emerge process
(if any) and a directory for each implementation found, which in turn contains
a log for the pkg-config process, one for the compilation of the test suite,
one that checks whether the linking is correct and finally the test suit
execution log.

.PP
The logs are present only if the related process has been performed. For
instance, no log is available for the emerge process if the package was already
compiled. Please refer to the main.log file to see which processes have been
skipped.
